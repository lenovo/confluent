nodereseat(8) -- Request a reseat of a node
============================================

## SYNOPSIS

`nodereseat <noderange>`  

## DESCRIPTION

`nodereseat` requests the enclosure manager of the current node to reseat that
node's slot.  This should be equivalent to removing the system entirely from
the chassis and putting it back in, but without actually having to do so.

## OPTIONS

* `-m MAXNODES`, `--maxnodes=MAXNODES`:
  Specify a maximum number of nodes to run the command with, prompting if over
  the threshold
  
* `-h`, `--help`:
  Show help message and exit

## EXAMPLES

* Reseating the node `s1`:
    `# nodereseat s1`  
    `s1: Reseat successful`
